When using other sharp and durable cutting wheels, the grinding wheel may appear to be vibrated for various reasons. Please pay attention to the following items to avoid these problems.
Reduce workpiece speed and increase wheel contact length
Check the condition of the grinding wheel shaft (especially the bearing)
Check the natural frequency of the grinding wheel and spindle device, try to make the spindle natural frequency / grinding wheel speed = integer + 1‚ÅÑ4,
Do not use the same wheel speed as the machine's natural frequency
Increase the grinding wheel speed, avoiding the ratio of the grinding wheel to the workpiece speed is an integer
Frequently dress the grinding wheel, adjust the dressing parameters (to make the surface of the grinding wheel more open), and replace the grinding wheel with a harder level.
Check the looseness of the workpiece clamp
